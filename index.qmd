## Welcome

These are the materials for a one-day workshop on <b>Building data science workflows in Python using Posit tools</b> on Monday, 18 Sept 2023 at [posit::conf 2023](http://pos.it/conf)!

In this Python-focused workshop, we will discuss ways to improve your data science workflows. During the course, we will review packages for data validation, alerting, modeling, and more.
